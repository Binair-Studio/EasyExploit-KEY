#### Please note that EasyExploit is currently using the Krnl API, so to make it easier for everyone, we have taken the documentation from https://krnl.place/ and modified it here to our benefit.

1. To check that you have Windows 10 and it's 64bit
-- Use your eyeballs and 4 braincells to visually inspect the desktop environment, icons, start menu then compare them to        images/screenshots online.
-- Type 64bit into the search bar in Windows 10. It should pop up with a suggestion saying "Is my PC 32bit or 64bit".
--Click on it and see your Operating System architecture.

2. To check that you have the VC Redists
-- Go to the "Add or remove programs" section in the Windows 10 settings.
-- Then search for Visual C++ Redistributable.
-- If two programs named along the lines of Visual 2015-2019 x64 and x86 show up that means you have it.

3. To check that the .NET package is installed
-- Run the main EasyExploit executable file
-- If you are missing the .NET framework Windows will automatically ask you if you want to install it or not.
-- Click yes if prompted.

4. To check that the webclient version of Roblox is installed/install it.
-- Uninstall the Microsoft Store version of Roblox if you have it
-- Install the web version from the roblox website. Link is in the Requirements above

[](#1-issues-about-downloadingopening-EasyExploit)1 Issues about downloading/opening EasyExploit:
===================================================================================

[](#11-download-blocked-by-browser)1.1 Download blocked by browser
------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Heres the fix for most browsers

1.  Press the key combination CTRL + J
    
2.  It should take you to the downloads section of your browser.
    
3.  From there click on "Allow malicious file".
    

But don't be scared EasyExploit is completely safe. "But then why does my antivirus and browser say it is" you may ask. The answer to this question is explained in detail in the next part.

[](#12-antivirus-blocking-downloadingrunning-EasyExploit)1.2 Antivirus blocking downloading/running EasyExploit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#why-this-happens)Why this happens

*   Antiviruses usually mistake Roblox exploits as viruses due to their nature. Most if not all modern Roblox exploits work by injecting some sort of dll file into Roblox and running Lua code (Scripts) in the environment it creates.

*   But heres the catch: Dll injection isnt just used by game cheats. They are also used by __malware__. Due to this antivirus try to quarantine/delete all dll injectors they detect without actually knowing what if they are safe or not. You will usually see antivirus calling most exploits including EasyExploit a Cryptinject.msr trojan because of this.
    
*   "But then how can you prove EasyExploit isn't malware?" you might ask. User trust and safety is priority at EasyExploit, due to this the only hidden/protected part of the EasyExploit client is the dll that is injected into Roblox(This being krnl.dll). Other than the dll EasyExploit client is completely unobfuscated/unprotected. Both the EasyExploit bootstrapper _**and**_ krnl itself's code is completely readable using a .NET decompiler like dnSpy or DotPeek (or even just a text editor like notepad for the node js bootstrapper). This means that you _yes_ _**you**_ can look at the code that runs the Krnl client. Here are the links to both the bootstrapper and the main executable files source code.

#### [](#skip-this-step-if-you-dont-have-a-3rd-party-antivirus)SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU DONT HAVE A 3RD PARTY ANTIVIRUS

> To fix this issue you must uninstall any 3rd party antivirus from your system. Such as McAfee, Norton, Eset, Kaspersky etc. Sorry but there isnt another way of solving this issue. From my and many users experiences excluding/disabling 3rd party antivirus is terrible and doesnt yield consistent/reliable results.

Once that you have uninstalled your 3rd party antivirus and rebooted your pc (Or you didnt have any to begin with). Its time to exclude EasyExploit from Windows Defender which is the default antivirus that comes with Windows 10. To do this we recommend watching a tutorial from YouTube. But in short all you need to do is:

*   Go to the virus and threat protection settings in Windows 10.

[](#13-bootstrapperdownloader-issues)1.3 Bootstrapper/Downloader issues
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

##### [](#if-the-official-krnl-bootstrapper-from-krnlgg-doesnt-work-for-you-for-any-reason-even-after-you-excluded-it-from-windows-defender-here-are-some-things-you-can-try)If the official Krnl bootstrapper from krnl.gg doesnt work for you for any reason even after you excluded it from Windows Defender here are some things you can try:

*   Making sure you have all the requirements listed on the top of this guide
    
*   Making sure you dont have any 3rd party
    

antiviruses such as Avast, McAfee, AVG etc.

*   Making sure it isnt blocked by Windows Defender
    
*   Running it as administrator
    
*   Making sure its in a folder
    

If you have done all of this but you still cant see EasyExploit.exe or krnl.dll in the EasyExploit folder, bootstrapper getting stuck at EasyExploit.exe.config etc.  
You can try downloading EasyExploit by other means such as:

*   **Downloading from the pinned messages of their discord server**
    
All you need to do to use this version of Krnl is:

1.  Download the rar/zip file.
    
2.  Extract to a folder excluded from Windows Defender.
    
3.  Open EasyExploit.exe located inside it.
    
4.  Then you can disregard any warning that says "Roblox version is incorrect" as its not an issue.
    

#### [](#second-way-downloading-and-extracting-the-krnl-ziprar-version-from-their-discord-server)Second way: Downloading and extracting the EasyExploit zip/rar version from our discord server.

*   There should almost always be a zip/rar file uploaded and pinned in the support channel of their discord server.
*   Their discord invite is https://discord.gg/aqYmPfdUTc
*   To use this version:
    1.  You must extract it to a folder excluded from Windows Defender.
    2.  To do this see part 1.2 of this guide.
    3.  After extracting it all you need to do is run EasyExploit.exe.

[](#2--issues-about-injectingexecuting)2- Issues about injecting/executing:
===========================================================================

[](#21-unknown-errorcrashing-when-injecting)2.1 Unknown error/crashing when injecting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   You might sometimes find yourself in this error box when you try to inject EasyExploit.
    
*   Before we try any solutions though check that you have the requirements to run EasyExploit (Located at the top of this guide)
    

If you have the requirements but you are still getting an error you can try these steps:

*   Reinstall/Repair VC Redist x64/x86 2015-2019
    
*   Reinstall Roblox
    
*   Make sure you have the latest version of EasyExploit
    
*   Redownload EasyExploit
    
*   Make sure any antiviruses aren't running and you excluded EasyExploit from windows defender
    

[](#22-EasyExploit-is-getting-stuck-at-saying-injecting)2.2 EasyExploit is getting stuck at saying "Injecting"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   This error is caused by the included injector that comes with EasyExploit.exe being not very good.

To solve this issue you need to use a 3rd party injector such as Extreme Injector or the built-in dll injection functionality of other software such as Process Hacker.

We recommend watching a YouTube tutorial on how to do this. Heres a link to one made by me [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QzXe2Jr_y0) But here's a quick rundown of the basic steps involved.

After injecting all you need to do is getting a key. How to do this can be found in step 3. After you enter your key in it and press enter. It should automatically close the console window and the "Inject" button in the Krnl UI should turn into "Injected"

[](#23-roblox-process-not-found-error)2.3 Roblox Process not found error
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is caused by the fact that the Microsoft Store version of EasyExploit isnt injectable. You have to use the Roblox version from their own website to use EasyExploit. Install roblox from [https://www.roblox.com/download](https://www.roblox.com/download) to fix this issue.

[](#24-krnldll-missing-issue)2.4 krnl.dll missing issue
-------------------------------------------------------

*   This issue is caused by either antivirus deleting krnl.dll thinking its malicious _or_ the bootstrapper failing to download it for whatever reason.

*   To solve this check step 1.2. After making sure no 3rd party antiviruses are present and that your whole C drive is excluded from Windows Defender try downloading EasyExploit zip/rar version talked about in step 1.3.
*   If after downloading and extracting the zip/rar version you are still missing krnl.dll then its confirmed to be an antivirus issue. Find a way to stop it from deleting EasyExploit.

[](#25-executing-crashes-roblox)2.5 Executing crashes Roblox
------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#this-issue-is-caused-by)This issue is caused by

*   The script you are trying to use contains invalid lua code
    
*   The script you are trying to use is patched
    
*   The script you are trying to use is not supported in EasyExploit
    

### [](#tldr-find-a-different-script)TLDR: Find a different script

[](#26-stuck-at-waiting-for-roblox)2.6 Stuck at waiting for roblox
------------------------------------------------------------------

*   This issue is caused by one of the hooks that are made by EasyExploit at injection overwritten by another application eg. Msi Afterburner. To fix this close all apps running in the background and reopen Roblox then try injecting EasyExploit again.
